## Usage

1. Add the ofxKinectForWindows2Lib.vcxproj to your solution
2. In `Property Manager` (open it from `View -> Other Windows -> Property Manager`), right click on your project to select `Add Existing Property Sheet...` and select the `ofxKinectForWindows2.props` file
3. Right click on your project (e.g. 'mySketch') and select 'Add Reference...', and add a reference to `ofxKinectForWindows2Lib`.

## Notes

0. The depth image comes in as RAW (i'm not rescaling it), so it may appear dark. Look closely :)
1. This addon does not ship with any libraries, it'll look locally on your system for them (and hence should work with VS2012, VS2013, etc)
2. You'll need to get a copy of the Kinect v2 SDK (i'm testing with v1404 April release)
